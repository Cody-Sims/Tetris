Tetris README

Overview: My Tetris program has 5 classes
    - Square: This class is a component of both the block and board class. It is used to create a 30x30 square at a
    given x and y position. By utilizing loops I can use this to create multiple squares for the blocks and boards
    - Block: This class creates a random block and adds it to the root pane. This block can be moved and rotated with
    key input. When it reaches the bottom or collides with another block, it is added to the board
    - Board: This class sets up the board and its borders. It is also responsible for detecting a block's collision with
    blocks already added to the board
    _ Tetris: This is the class where all the logic occurs. Key input and timelines are set up here. The piece is
    constantly moved down, and when the game is over the timelines are stopped
    - Pane Organizer: This sets up the main pane and adds a quit button
